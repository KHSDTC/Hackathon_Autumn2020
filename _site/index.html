<h1 id="data-hackathon-autumn-session-2019">Data Hackathon Autumn Session 2019</h1>

<p>Everyone is invited to a third instalment of King’s College London HSDTC Hackathon sessions. The event is intended for everyone with interest in computational and quantitative methods in biology and how such methods can be used to tackle unique challenges of interest to our community.</p>

<p>Our idea is to bring researchers from various backgrounds for an evening of computational biology problem solving.</p>

<p>We aim to provide a relaxed environment for people to engage, discuss and exchange programming knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="theme-of-the-evening">Theme of the evening</h2>

<p>The Hackathon session will be focusing on <strong>Data Science</strong> approaches, such as <strong>Data Processing</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, that can be applied to tackle biological problems.</p>

<p>Our task will consists of investigating a publicly available dataset, selecting statistical models and setting up an analysis pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="coding-language-of-the-evening">Coding language of the evening</h2>

<p>This session will primarily focus on Python-specific approaches for solving Hackathon challenges. However, you are welcome to use any language of your choice. We are always looking to improving ourselves!</p>

<h2 id="for-whom-is-this-hackathon-intended">For whom is this Hackathon intended?</h2>

<p>The Hackathon is suitable for anyone at King’s, including undergraduate and postgraduate students, Post-Docs and PIs, who regularly use or wish to regularly use coding for their research, regardless of their level of expertise with programming.</p>

<h2 id="hackathon-format">Hackathon format</h2>

<p>We will divide ourselves in groups of 4-5 people and attempt in solving the given evening challenge.</p>

<h2 id="hackathon-challenges">Hackathon challenges</h2>

<p>The Hackathon organisers will provide you with a dataset and a set of tasks to tackle during the evening. There will be a group of experienced coders and bioinformaticians to help you out with the challenge.</p>

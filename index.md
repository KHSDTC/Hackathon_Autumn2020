# King's College London Health Science DTC

## Data Hackathon

Everyone is invited to a fourth instalment of King's College London HSDTC Hackathon sessions. The event is intended for everyone with interest in computational and quantitative methods in biology and how such methods can be used to tackle unique challenges of interest to our community.

Our idea is to bring researchers from various backgrounds for an evening of computational biology problem solving. We aim to provide a relaxed environment for people to engage, discuss and exchange programming knowledge.

## Theme of the evening

The Spring session will be a __beginners-focused__ event, where we will learn about basics of __Python__, __Data Manipulation__ and __Machine Learning__.

## For whom is this Hackathon intended?

The Hackathon is suitable for beginners at King's, including undergraduate and postgraduate students, Post-Docs and PIs, regardless of their level of expertise with programming. You should come if you who wish to start using coding in your research or practice what you have learnt before. 

## Hackathon format

The Hackathon will be divided into three parts:

- __Part 1:__ Basics of Python programming.
- __Part 2:__ Data manipulation using _pandas_.
- __Part 3:__ Simple machine learning models using _scikit-learn_.

The format of the event will consist of live-coding demonstrations and mini-coding challenges for you to solve. 

Given enough time, you will be a get a task of investigating a publicly available dataset, selecting a statistical model and setting up an analysis pipeline.

There will be a group of experienced coders and bioinformaticians to help you out with the challenge.

## Coding language of the evening

This session will primarily focus on Python-specific approaches for solving Hackathon challenges. 

## What do you need to bring

- Laptops, power supplies and an inquisitive spirit.

### For Python

- Working Python environment (3.x) that could be provided by downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
- Working [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/index.html) that is [already shipped using Anaconda](https://jupyter.org/install).
- Code editor of your liking, for instance [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) or [spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/).

## When and Where?

- __Date__: 23rd of March, 2020
- __Where__: G552, Waterloo Bridge Wing, Waterloo Campus
- __When__: 5PM - 9PM

The doors are open at 5PM  and everyone is welcome to come and network with fellow coders! The Hackathon session will start at 5:30PM and during the evening we will have food and drinks provided by HSDTC.

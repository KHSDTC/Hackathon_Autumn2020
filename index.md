# King's College London Health Science DTC

## Data Hackathon 101

Everyone is invited to a fourth installment of King's College London HSDTC Hackathon sessions. The event is intended for everyone with interest in computational and quantitative methods in biology and how such methods can be used to tackle unique challenges of interest to our community.

Our idea is to bring researchers from various backgrounds for an evening of computational biology problem solving. We aim to provide a relaxed environment for people to engage, discuss and exchange programming knowledge.

## Theme of the evening

During the session we will learn about __Python__ programming, __Data Manipulation__ and __Machine Learning__.

## For whom is Hackathon 101 intended?

This session will be a __beginners-focused__ event and is suitable for anyone, including undergraduate and postgraduate (taught and research) students, Post-Docs and PIs. 

Do you wish to begin coding to accelerate your research? Or you have some initial experience, but need additional practice? This event is just for you! 

If you are a more experienced coder, still do come and share your expertise with everyone around!

## Hackathon format

The Hackathon will consist of three online sessions spaced out across three weeks. 

- The __first__ session will introduce:
	- _Part 1:_ Basics of Python programming.
	- _Part 2:_ Data manipulation using _pandas_.

- The __second__ session will cover:
	- _Part 3:_ Application of machine learning models using _scikit-learn_.

The format of the first two sessions will consist of live-coding demonstrations and mini-coding challenges for you to solve. There will be a group of experienced coders to help you out with any issues.

In parallel, you will be divided into groups and given a task of investigating a publicly available dataset, selecting appropriate modelling tools and setting up an analysis pipeline.

During the __third__ and final session, each group will present about how they approached the given challenge. The awards await the best presentations!

To solve the final challenge as a group, it is crucial that you are able to attend all three sessions. Please do take into consideration the session dates when registering.

## Coding language of the evening

This session will primarily focus on Python-specific approaches for solving Hackathon challenges. 

## What do you need to have

- An operating computer, a stable internet connection and an inquisitive spirit.

### For Python

There is no need to download or install anything, expect for having an access to a Google account. The code writing and excecution will be solely performed on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) platform. But more on that later!

## When and Where?

- __Date__: 2nd, 9th and 16th of November, 2020.
- __Where__: Online, Microsoft Teams.
- __When__: 5:00PM - 8PM.

The doors are open at 5PM and everyone is welcome to come and network with fellow coders! The Hackathon session will start at 5:15PM.

## Registration

Please complete your registration at [SkillsForge booking page](https://training.kcl.ac.uk/kcl/#he/dev/eventDetails,;em,providerCode=HSDTC,providerOrgAlias=kcl,number=109,). There are only 30 places available, thus in order to ensure your place for the Hackathon, make ensure that you are registered.
